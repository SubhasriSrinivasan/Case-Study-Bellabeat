# Case-Study-Bellabeat
## Business Task
To analyze FitBit Fitness Tracker Data to gain insights into how consumers are using the FitBit app 
and discover trends to improve the marketing strategy of bellabeat.
## Business Objective
<br>1. What are some trends in smart device usage?
<br>2. How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?
<br>3. How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?
## Data sources used
FitBit Fitness Tracker Data (https://www.kaggle.com/arashnic/fitbit) <br>
This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users.<br>
Here, I have selected dailyActivity_merged.csv, sleepDay_merged.csv and weightLogInfo_merged.csv for my analysis

## Analysis Conclusion
1. Majority of users (81.3%) are using the FitBit app to track sedentary activities and not using it for tracking their health habits.<br>
2. Users prefer to track their activities from tuesday to thursday but declines from Friday to monday. This may happen as saturday and sunday are weekends so they may feel lazy while monday and friday being the first day and last day of the week they might be busy doing their office work.<br>
3. Users logged on an average of 7,637 steps or 5.4km which is not adequate. As recommended by CDC, an adult female has to aim at least 10,000 steps or 8km per day to benefit from general health, weight loss and fitness improvement.<br>
4. Both the companies develop products focused on providing women with their health, habit and fitness data and encouraging them to understand their current habits and make healthy decisions. These common trends surrounding health and fitness can very well be applied to Bellabeat customers.<br>
5. The problem found here was that people are not logging in or they forget to log in to solve this they should have an auto synch facility in their bellabeat leaf so that the users dont have to track it manually. <br>
6. Bellabeat marketing team can encourage users by educating and equipping them with knowledge about fitness benefits, suggest different types of exercise and calories intake and burnt rate information on the Bellabeat app.
7. On weekends, Bellabeat app can also prompt notification to encourage users to exercise.
8. As this is specially made for women we can also include menstrual cycle traker and prediction for the future cycles.
